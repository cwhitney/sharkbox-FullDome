# sharkbox-FullDome
====

A fullome fisheye renderer for Cinder 0.9.0.

Big thanks to Paul Bourke whose work was critical to figuring this out, specifically [this post](http://paulbourke.net/dome/unityfisheye/).

How it works
---
Internally FullDome will create four cameras.  Two that look left and right of center 45 degrees on the X-axis, and then 2 that look straight up and straight down with a 45 degree Y-axis twist.

Each draw cycle each, one is bound and then rendered to an FBO.  Each FBO is then bound and mapped to a piece of geometry that makes up a piece of the final circular fisheye render.  This means that for each one frame, the scene is drawn four times.

You can change the size of the individual fbos in the constructor.  The default is 2048 x 2048. Below we're setting it to 1024 x 1024.

```mFullDome = FullDome::create( &mCam, 1024 );```


Usage
--
Create a normal PerspCamera to drive the fulldome camera. 

```
CameraPersp mCam;
mFullDome = FullDome::create( &mCam );
```
During your draw render your scene once for each camera. 

```
mFullDome->bindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::LEFT);
render();
mFullDome->unbindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::LEFT);
    
mFullDome->bindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::RIGHT);
render();
mFullDome->unbindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::RIGHT);
    
mFullDome->bindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::UP);
render();
mFullDome->unbindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::UP);
    
mFullDome->bindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::DOWN);
render();
mFullDome->unbindCamera(FullDome::DomeCam::DOWN);
```

The image can then be drawn directly, or rendered to an FBO.

```
mFullDome->draw();
```

or

```
mFullDome->renderToFbo();
gl::TextureRef texRef = mFullDome->getFboTexture();
```

As a caveat, if your lighting calculations are in camera space, they will render funny since the final image is made up of four different cameras.  Check the included shaders for an example.
